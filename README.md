This is a text-based RPG game that I currently trying to make! Anyone is free to clone this code and help out! I am currently using xcode and I added some functionality with c++11, so make sure the compiler accepts this!
-Just create a new project in whatever IDE you are using, add the header and source files and compile it! :D
